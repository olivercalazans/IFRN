- **alunos_ifrn.py** - This code makes a request to IFRN for data on all campuses and their details. With this data, it creates a list of all campuses with the number of courses each one has. Additionally, if a campus is chosen, it creates a list of all courses at that campus with the number of students per course. If desired, it creates a file with the data of the chosen campus.
